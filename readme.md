# Cocktailz
Cocktailz was created by Elizabeth Edelman, Owen Baker, Elena Cussler, and David Garcia.

## Description 
Have you ever wanted to impress your friends with new drinks, needed some drink ideas for an upcomming wedding? Our exciting new app, Cocktailz will do all the work for you. Cocktailz will let you generate a random cocktail, with ingredients and instructions on how to make said cocktail. Additionally, Cocktailz provides a list of nearby liquor stores in the city of Denver.

What did we learn?
During this project we learned how to use Github in a team enviornment, resolve merge conflicts, and debug in the terminal. The group was able to increase familiarity with Javascript, calling 3rd party API's and expanding our Bootstrap styling knowledge.
